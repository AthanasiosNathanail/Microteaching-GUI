This is a simple GUI application to facilitate a microteaching experience. 
This mini-lesson introduces the use of decision tree algorithms to classify geophysical data (e.g., porosity and resistivity) for reservoir identification (reservoir and non-reservoir zones). 
It aims to engage learners through active, collaborative, and student-centered methods. The target audience includes individuals with minimal or no prior experience in machine learning or geoscience, ensuring accessibility to diverse backgrounds. 
The session incorporates active learning strategies, metacognitive prompts, and collaborative exercises to foster understanding and engagement. Building on peer feedback, students will now interact with a GUI‐based interface (provided via a link) rather than writing code on their machine. 
Through visual explanations and collaborative discussions, they will understand the algorithm’s application, challenges, and limitations in real-world geoscience scenarios.
